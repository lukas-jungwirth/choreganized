# Decisions

Running log of product/tech decisions, including deliberate deviations from the design file.
Agents: when you make a judgment call that isn't in SPEC/ARCHITECTURE, **append it here**
(next number, one short block). When you deviate from a plan, note it in the plan file too.

## Resolved

1. **Auth is Google-only in v1** — design [5a] shows email+password and an Apple button; the
   stack decision (Better Auth, Google OAuth only, email later) wins. Login renders a single
   Google button; Settings has no Password row. Revisit when adding email or passkeys.
2. **Effort presets are the canonical points**: 5 / 10 / 20 / 40 (Small/Medium/Large/Very
   large) per [3b] and the brief. The stray +15/+25 values in some mockups are design
   artifacts. `points` is stored as an int, so custom values are possible later without
   migration.
3. **No Tailwind.** Vanilla CSS + design tokens + scoped styles (the design is bespoke; tokens
   map 1:1). Prevents two styling systems drifting.
4. **Drizzle ORM over raw SQL/Prisma** — TS schema, real migrations, negligible runtime,
   first-class better-sqlite3 support. Answers the brief's "some ORM if valuable?" → yes.
5. **The task row is the occurrence** (no occurrences table): recurring tasks keep one row;
   completing advances `dueDate` and logs an immutable `task_completions` snapshot. Simplest
   model that supports the whole design (incl. undo, rotation, reminders). Trade-off: no
   future-occurrence preview — not in the design anyway.
6. **Next due is computed from completion day**, not the missed due date ([4d] shows "Next due
   Aug 14" for a monthly task completed Jul 14 → today-based). Overdue tasks don't pile up
   phantom occurrences.
7. **One household per user (v1)** — enforced by a unique index on `members.userId` only;
   schema otherwise supports multi-household. Leaving/removal → back to onboarding.
8. **Timezone lives on the household** (captured from the creator's browser, default
   Europe/Vienna). All calendar dates are household-local TEXT `YYYY-MM-DD`; reminders fire at
   08:00 household-local. Weeks start Monday. UI English (i18n later).
9. **Leaderboard month is derived** from completion timestamps in the household timezone — no
   monthly reset job, history keeps all months.
10. **Any member can invite** (view/share the active code); only the **owner** can revoke/
    regenerate the code, change roles, remove members, rename the household. (Design labels the
    members screen "owner view" but only scopes roles/removal to owner in copy; for a
    two-person household, member-invite is friendlier.)
11. **Single owner, "Make owner" transfers** the role (the design offers no multi-owner UI
    like demote). Owner must transfer before leaving; the last member leaving deletes the
    household (confirm dialog).
12. **Removed/left members**: membership row deleted; their completions keep name snapshots
    ("points stay with the house"); their assigned tasks become **Anyone**.
13. **Checked shopping items auto-clear** ~12 h after checking (nightly cleanup cron). Keeps
    the "2 of 9 done" trip context without a manual clear chore.
14. **Cook-mode timers & ingredient highlights are parsed, not authored** — durations via regex
    from step text ("8 min", "8:00", "8–10 minutes" → first value), ingredient underlines via
    case-insensitive name matching. Recipe form stays plain text ([3c] has no timer fields).
    Manual "Set timer" stepper covers unparsed steps.
15. **Timer push precision**: in-process `setTimeout` at creation (second-precision) + minute
    cron as restart-safe catch-up; the row in `cook_timers` is the source of truth.
16. **One meal slot per day** (dinner) — `UNIQUE(householdId, date)` per the design's week
    list. Lunch/breakfast would be a schema extension (add a `slot` column) later.
17. **Sheets are components, not routes** (except recipe form + cook mode, which are
    deep-linkable routes). Keeps URLs clean and the tab shell stable.
18. **Recipe images**: uploaded to `UPLOADS_DIR` volume, resized to ≤1200px WebP via `sharp`
    (added in plan 07), served through an authed endpoint that checks household membership.
    Not `static/` — uploads must not be world-readable or lost on redeploy.
19. **adapter-node + one container + SQLite volume** — no separate DB image (answers the
    brief's Dockerfile question). Backups via nightly `.backup`/Litestream, plan 11.
20. **Load + form actions only** (no experimental remote functions, no client fetch layer);
    JSON endpoints only for push subscribe, timers, uploads. Progressive enhancement via
    `use:enhance`.
21. **"Anyone" tasks nudge everyone** (due/overdue reminders go to all members with the
    relevant toggle on; assigned tasks nudge only the assignee).
22. **Popular starters** ([7f]) prefill: bins Weekly Small·5, bedsheets Monthly Medium·10,
    bathroom Every-2-weeks Large·20 — assignee Anyone, first due today, editable after.

## Open questions (non-blocking, defaults chosen)

- **Production domain** — invite links & OAuth redirect need the final origin (design shows
  `choreganized.app`). Default: whatever Coolify serves; set `ORIGIN`/`BETTER_AUTH_URL`.
- **Google OAuth credentials** — need a GCP OAuth client (redirect URI
  `{origin}/api/auth/callback/google`) before plan 00 can be verified end-to-end.
- **Language** — UI is English like the design; German/i18n not planned for v1.
- **Recipe share** ([7c] "Share") — v1 ships plain-text share (Web Share API). Public share
  links would need a tokenized public route; deferred.

## Later (explicitly out of v1 scope)

SSE live updates · passkeys · email auth · Apple sign-in · multi-household ·
meal slots beyond dinner · offline mutations · recipe import from URL · iOS polish pass.
